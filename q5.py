"""
Find the element in a singly linked list that's m elements from the end.
For example, if a linked list has 5 elements, the 3rd element from the end is
the 3rd element. The function definition should look like question5(ll, m),
where ll is the first node of a linked list and m is the "mth number from the
end". You should copy/paste the Node class below to use as a representation of
a node in the linked list. Return the value of the node at that position.
e.g. 10->20->30->40->50
